            <p>
                My name is Timothy O'Malley, an apsiring Software Engineer/Web Developer. In college I worked with C and C++ and have a pretty strong foundation those. I am currently
                a mechanincal engineer that does HVAC engineering for industrial/commercial buildings. This isn't directly related to software/web development I think a lot of the 
                problem solving skills I have from engineering will be applicable in a the tech industry.
                <br>
                <br>
                I am currently taking a 6 month coding bootcamp at Northwestern University to get the skills necessary to become a full stack web developer. As of now we have done a 
                done a lot of work with HTML/CSS/Javascript and many other technologies in conjunction with them. These other technologies include APIs both native to the web and third
                party, jquery, and multiple CSS frameworks.
